# PROGRESS — Apartment Management System

## Current State
- **Phase:** DONE — all gates approved, deployment prep complete
- **Gate:** G1 ✅ G2 ✅ G3 ✅ G4 ✅ (2026-06-03)
- **Last completed:** 2026-06-05 — GET /api/blocks: PageResponse + name search (Criteria API) + sort + pagination. 9 tests pass. FE callers (AnnouncementsPage, ApartmentsPage) unchanged — already read .data. Commits: 98457cd, 49dc48e, c70871f.
- **Also 2026-06-05:** Ticket assign form: replaced raw UUID input with async SearchableSelect dropdowns. Staff: 3-call merge (ADMIN+BOARD_MEMBER+TECHNICIAN) — BE only supports single role param. Contractor: shown only for MAINTENANCE_REPAIR, hidden otherwise. Mutual exclusivity enforced. scheduledDate + notes added to payload. Admin: VehiclesPage with async resident SearchableSelect (GET /api/residents?search=&size=20&isActive=true), apartment auto-derived from selected resident (no independent apartment picker), 409→"Biển số đã được đăng ký". Resident: MyVehiclesPage self-scoped via /residents/me (no list calls to /residents or /apartments), unit shown read-only. nginx rebuilt; 201 and 409 verified via curl.
- **Blocked:** None
